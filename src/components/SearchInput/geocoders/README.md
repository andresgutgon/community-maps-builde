# What?
More geocoders for other services can be found in [leaflet-control-geocoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-control-geocoder). We don't use this packages because
the UI that we build is done with React and this package has a lot of redundant CSS / JS we don't need. We just need their Geocoder implementation.
